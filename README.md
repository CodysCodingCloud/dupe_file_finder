# Finding Duplicate Photos
I ended up with a hell of a lot of duplicates in my dropbox when we shared photos. We both wanted to hoard the memories and ended up copying them for ourselves and ended up with a massive collection. 

## Current State
At the current state of this repo we have found all the duplicates and saved the list to a file.

## To Dos
- create a bash script to run this anywhere
- deal with the photos duplicates
  - I like deleting the new copies and keeping only the original
- photo metadata
  - the metadata of the creation and modified times should match instead of being all over the place if I want to be able to sort them right
  - file naming needs to be consistent
    - Dropbox renames our photos to their own convention
    - apple has their own convention as well
